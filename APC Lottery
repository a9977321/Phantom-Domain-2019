Idea: Should we give out chances to upgrade "revealed" abilities as a prize for being the sole winner? 
For instance Ability_lv1_oracle can be upgraded into lv2, confirming the alliance of the good player in the combination. 

The usual unique ability is the other alternative. 

Current proposal
DAY/Usual Prize/Extra Prize
DAY5/ 1 token/ 1 token
Day10/ 1 token/ Ability upgrade
Day15/ 4-token-value mod unit pack/ Mod lab info of day5, 10, 15
Day20/ Free mod unit purchase list*1/ Ability upgrade
Day25/ 3 tokens/ Ability upgrade
Day30/
