"Greetings BH,
I am a humble neutral player who has discovered GS and RF are Good.
This makes it likely that you are the phantom.
I know who the other evil player is and if you tell me you are the phantom I will happily 
pass on the information to that player so you can receive support which you will 
almost certainly need in the coming battle.

What do I gain from this?
I am being paid with some lovely tokens for my services.
Also it is in my best interests not to have the good players meet up so soon, defeat 
the evil players and win quickly. After all, there are only 2 evil players and 4 good 
players. Doesn't seem fair does it?
Please reply to this message with your answer and the mod will give me your 
response which I will forward to the other evil player and get paid!"

BH's reply to PL

Aha, interesting tidings indeed! I am indeed the phantom and would dearly like to know who the other evil player is. I was already fairly sure that RF was good, I also think YC might be too. AB seems to have some knowledge of what's going on, but I'm not sure if he's good or neutral. Once I know who our enemies are we can coordinate and destroy them. 

To the neutral player: your services in this matter are appreciated. If you'd reveal your identity I'll refrain from attacking you.
