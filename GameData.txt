"Greetings BH,
I am a humble neutral player who has discovered GS and RF are Good.
This makes it likely that you are the phantom.
I know who the other evil player is and if you tell me you are the phantom I will happily 
pass on the information to that player so you can receive support which you will 
almost certainly need in the coming battle.

What do I gain from this?
I am being paid with some lovely tokens for my services.
Also it is in my best interests not to have the good players meet up so soon, defeat 
the evil players and win quickly. After all, there are only 2 evil players and 4 good 
players. Doesn't seem fair does it?
Please reply to this message with your answer and the mod will give me your 
response which I will forward to the other evil player and get paid!"

BH's reply to PL

Aha, interesting tidings indeed! I am indeed the phantom and would dearly like to know who the other evil player is. I was already fairly sure that RF was good, I also think YC might be too. AB seems to have some knowledge of what's going on, but I'm not sure if he's good or neutral. Once I know who our enemies are we can coordinate and destroy them. 

To the neutral player: your services in this matter are appreciated. If you'd reveal your identity I'll refrain from attacking you.

Greetings BH,
Thank-you for your message. Unfortunately my reply will be late since I cannot

At the current time I do not wish to reveal the identity of myself or my employer.
My employer also thanks you for your reply, and says they will reveal themselves 
at a later date when you share a border with them.

Greetings BH,
This is from my patron (the player paying me in delicious tokens):

Your response to my last message will be delayed (also because of mod turn order) 
so I will have sent this before I received your reply.
I would like to know why you are fighting YC. As the phantom you know the identity 
of all the good players. I have received intel from several players that YC is neutral 
and at peace with other players, so why are you solely at war with YC?

BH's reply to PL

I've received the same intel as you that YC is neutral. I'm at war with him partly because of simple opportunism and partly because of long-term planning. 

Very early I had the opportunity to snatch the base at 23,22, and did so. I figured with a 4:2 lead in bases I'd be in a position to win a fight with YC, which would set me up to later take on the good players. And of course I don't want to tip my hand to the good team too soon - hence not attacking them while I focus on YC. 

Having said that my war with YC is stalling somewhat (mostly because of some irritating mod units, I suspect he's player 4). Obviously I don't know where you're situated or if you're in a position to assist but if you could offer any help it would speed things up a bit.

Greetings BH,
This is likely the last message you will receive from me for a while, my patron has 
received all the info they wanted so my services are currently not being engaged.
So this is a message from myself personally (though you will again receive it late 
due to mod turn order so some of the info may no longer matter).

You may of course engage my services as well!
I offer anonymous mod messages sent for only half a token, that's half price!
You won't find a better deal elsewhere 😂

My patron may choose to help your fight, I'm not sure, but it seems likely.
I personally won't participate since it's not in my interest...

PL sent an anonymous message to GS. (Ability_Mr_Anonymous)

Greetings GS, I have determined you are likely to be the Phantom.

Firstly, rest assured that I am the other evil player. Unfortunately I can't reveal which 
country I am yet, I have to keep myself safe.
One of my abilities allows me to track token numbers to an extent, which works well 
with my Curse ability. 
On day 11 you gained tokens, most likely due to an ability since lab and APC tokens 
were given the previous day. However, on day 11 BH also lost tokens (but did not 
spend them on mod units or questing area purchase). This makes it likely you used 
a steal ability on them.
On day 6 you also gained tokens while RF lost token, probably another steal ability 
activation.
Steal ability is for evil players and BH is good players and Phantom knows the good 
players so can target them. Therefore you are most likely the Phantom!

If I am correct please reply with a link to a screenshot showing the NW Quadrant 
capture area being yours. This will confirm beyond doubt that you are the Phantom 
so I may feel safe revealing which country I am.
I could use my Ability_Curse to find out as well, but I'd rather not waste it if I can find 
out this way without it.
